# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is saving states-in-time and allowing for parallel work streams. It is useful because you can have multiple developers working on different parts of the same project without duplicating work, creating (unneccesary) merge issues, or requiring a "checkout" system.  Additional, it allows for reinstating to a period of time that the software was working correctly should something go wrong.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a parallel version of the same project that allows for development and testing without impacting the original.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a saved point in time. A good commit message would allow a third party (or yourself) to understand the types of changes made during that commit and the impact on the project.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when there is a discrepancy in changes. In an example, when two non-master branches are merged into a master and supply conflicting changes.
