##research on http requests

What are some common HTTP status codes?
 * 200 OK
 * 403 Forbidden
 * 404 Not Found
 * 401 Unauthorized
 * 304 Not Modified
 * 201 Created
 * 204 No Content
 * 500 Internal Server Error
What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
 * A GET request is likely how you typically use a browswer. Go to a webiste and request data to be consumed
 * A POST request is actually sending data to the server. I'd imagine this could be upload a document or submitting login credentials.

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
 * Cookies are small text files that store information. Since the web server and the web browser do not stay connected this allows for a more seamless transfer of information that next time the two connect.
