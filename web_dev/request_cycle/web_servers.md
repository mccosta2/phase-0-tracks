## web server questions
What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
 * Linux is small, efficient, gives the user control (without handholding) and compartmentalizes programs into small but effective units.
In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
 * a VPS is a computer that is created (physically or in memory) based on your needs.  The advantages are you are only using what you need and can add power / space easily.
Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
 * seemingly you want to avoid this because then your programs are partioned from a security perspective and therefore can do everything you need without destroying your base operating system.
