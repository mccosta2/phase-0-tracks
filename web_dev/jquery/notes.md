#Learning JQuery

* I've done some research and found two websites that I think are best suited to my preferred learning styles

* http://jqfundamentals.com/ 

* The site above is nice because it has an in-browser text editor that will allow me to practice concepts.

* https://learn.jquery.com/

* The site above will be more supplemental for concepts that I do not quite get immediately with jqfundamentals.com, I can take a look from a different persecptive.  The general flow of learning is is similar and therefore will be easy to follow similar concepts.

* I will use the in site editor at jqfundamentals.com for each new concept that I don't understand right away. If the concept is intuitive but very new I will try that right away.

* This isn't my first time reviewing JQuery, so I will approach it in a sort of "review", "research (as needed)" and "implement" sort of way.

-----------------

Two hours in I feel quite comfortable with the basics of JQuery and feel even more confortable with the javascript concepts of ancestors, siblings, children, etc.

It is worth noting that I covered:
* JavaScript Basics
* JQuery Basics
* Traversing & Manipulating

In the two hours I was unable to get deep into Events * Event Delelgation, but I would like to learn more. In the mean time I will adhere to the two hour time limit for this assignment.
